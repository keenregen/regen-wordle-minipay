<h2 align="center"> Summary of The RegenWordle App</h2>

  <p align="center">
Traditional methods of teaching about blockchain often involve lengthy and technical explanations, which may not attract the learners' attention. As a result, individuals might lose interest or become disengaged from the learning process. Our app addresses this issue by incorporating game-like elements and meaningful gifts.

RegenWordle is an interactive app that gamifies learning by offering a wordle-type game to teach fundamental concepts of blockchain in a way that promotes environmental responsibility.
